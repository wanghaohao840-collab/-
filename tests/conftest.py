"""Keep ordinary regression tests independent of workstation credentials.

Load this before collecting application modules: core.llm calls load_dotenv at
import time, which otherwise walks out of an isolated worktree into its parent.
Live integration tests opt in only through NEO4J_TEST_* / QDRANT_TEST_* settings;
unit tests inject any application configuration they need with monkeypatch.
